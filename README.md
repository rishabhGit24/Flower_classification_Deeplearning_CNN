Model Architecture
The goal of this project is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying flowers from images. Flowers come in many shapes, colors, and patterns, making this an interesting image classification problem. By training a CNN, we can extract and learn these features to classify different species of flowers.

Installation-
To set up the project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rishabhGit24/Flower_classification_Deeplearning_CNN.git
cd Flower_classification_Deeplearning_CNN
Install the necessary dependencies:

Dataset:
You can use any publicly available flower image dataset or create your own. A popular choice is the "Oxford 102 Flower Dataset," which contains 102 categories of flowers.


Model Architecture:
The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn and classify flower images. The CNN architecture includes:
Convolutional layers to extract image features
MaxPooling layers for downsampling
Fully connected layers to classify the image
Softmax activation in the final layer for multi-class classification
